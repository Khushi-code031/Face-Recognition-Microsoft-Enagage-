									<h3>Smart Camera</h3>
									<p>Atoms provides a smart camera which takes multiple images of the user into it's
										database to recognize and allow the authorized user	into the house. 	
										It stays alert and intelligently decides whom to allow into the house. 
										So the next time you're in a rush to leave or enter the house, you know whom to rely on!

									<h3>Auto Locking & Tight Security</h3>
									<p> 
										While a pin or password or a key could be misused by someone who may have seen it/stole it, 
										face recognition is a powerful feature that accurately identifies the person's face and their 
										expression to unlock the door. In case you forget to shut the door, unlike the traditional locks, 
										Atoms provides an "extra" edge over the obsolete and easy-to-break-through locks, by effectively locking
										the door,and further enhancing the safety and security for your home.

									<h3>Easy to Set-up</h3>
									<p> 
										Most Smart locks require you to remember either a password, code, or a pattern. In case you forget your 
										passcode, you are stuck outside your house and now it is difficult to get in. <br>
										Hence, Atoms Face Door Lock, is far more easy to use and trouble-free than the complicated smart locks available 
										in the market. The user just needs register their face using the smart camera to become an authorized user.
										Atoms Face Door Lock proves to be highly compatible, and hence it becomes easier for the <u><b>older generation</b></u> to use, 
										experience and take utmost advantage of the Smart Locks and Flexible technology.

									<h3>Bid Adieu to Physical Keys</h3>
									<p> A key is an important object that is required to be handled with care and losing it becomes 
										a matter of concern. Moreover, creating and distributing multiple copies of the key among your 
										family members adds to the worry of misplacing them. Atoms efficiently covers up on this problem
										by eliminating the use of physical key, and instead using a virtual key (face image of the authorized user)
										to open and shut the door. This feature offers the <u><b>blind and handicapped audience</b></u> to live life with little more
										ease, like the normal people around them.

									<h3>No Contact Needed </h3>
									<p>Imagine you're carrying large of amount of shopping bags. Now when you would want to enter the house,
										irrespective of the type of lock installed at the door of your home, you would have to keep the bags down
										on the floor, to either search for your physical key, or enter you password or scan your fingerprint. 
										Well, this problem is solves conveniently by Atoms-Smart Face Door Lock. Without contacting your door or the
										lock, you can enter your home, as the Smart camera detects and recognizes your face. Besides this, it ensures 
										a more safe and sanitary experience.

									<h3>Less Time-Consuming </h3>
									<p>	
										While using a simple lock and key system, a lot of time is consumed in taking out the keys from your bag,
										inserting it inside the cavity of the lock, and then unlocking the door. However, using the face 
										recognition feature offered by Atoms takes no more than a fraction of a second to open the door. 
										The user is thus facilitated with a seamless experience.</p>
